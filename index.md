I'm a USDA postdoctoral fellow who loves to study roots! My research focuses on characterizing plant developmental responses to stressors and working to mitigate negative effects in crop species. You can download my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/Haus_CV.pdf).

I recieved my PhD at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana where I studied the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on stomatal development in _Arabidopsis thaliana_. The results from some of this work seeded funding for collaborating labs to study similar effects in monocots. In addition to my research, I won teaching awards at the department, college, and university level. 

After graduating, a spent a small stint at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in the Mockler lab. I worked on a project studying the effects of drought in maize. I became fascinated by the role of root responses to stressors and how that will effect the response of the above ground plant. 

I started working at Michigan State University by characterizing dry bean root architecture and it's role in _Fusarium_ root rot (FRR) resilience. This has led me down a windy path to understand key developmental traits in the long history of dry beans.

### Summary of Research

Short paragraph about my work.
	Dry Bean Root Archiecture as a Means of FRR Resilience
	Characterizing Wild Bean Response to FRR and FW
	Characterization of Wild _Phaseolus vulgaris_ Root Architecture
	Identify Indirect Selection on Root Architecture in Dry Bean Breeding Programs

### Professional Goals

My goal is to become a tenure-track research professor at an R1 university. I want to continue to study the developmental responses of crop species to environmental stressors.
