At the top, I want rolling pics of my work?

Plant biologist who loves to study roots! I will expand on this intro to talk about beans!

Pic of me!
![My Face]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/MJH_Web1.jpg)

Editing a pic of me to be reasonable:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/MJH_Web1.jpg" alt="MJHaus" title="My face" width="250" height="250" />
	
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/MJH_Web1.jpg" alt="MJHaus" title="My face" width="250" height="250" ALIGN=”left” HSPACE=”50” VSPACE=”50” />
