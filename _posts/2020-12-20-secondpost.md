#Second Post

This is an example on how to add images. Also, I want to see how posts look together and interact with one another.

This is how to add an image from another website:
![alt text is white cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/VAN_CAT.png/480px-VAN_CAT.png)

I found this [Cat image on Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:VAN_CAT.png).

Attempt to display an image here.
